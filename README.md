# VSC-Theme-Awakening

VSC has an very long list of tools and widgets that come with the editor right out of the box, and theres hundreds, maybe thousands of useful extensions that can be taked onto the editor almost instantaneously.

VSC has an very long list of tools, widgets & extensions that can be downloaded and integrated into the editor, this includes an extreamly long list of themes that developers can choose from. One of the most important decisions developers face when using contemporary open-source editors is what theme to use. Choosing a underdeveloped,or unthought-out theme will havea a negative effect on any professional development environment. VS-Code, IMHO, is the best open-source editor currently available. Many tools come pre integrated into VSC right-out'a-da-box, no DLs necassary, however; many of the tools that VSC offers, as is the case with all other IDE's, are only as good as the rest of the enviroment, and every development environment requires some sort of customization, and as cuasality goes, customization will require work, and work will require that somethings be thought out; this is where JS-Dojo comes in. I originally built JS-Dojo for my self, I wanted it to take advantage of several features that VSCode has, but were not being taken advantage of by other themes. Devs seemed to be building pretty themes instead of themes that were contoured to VSC, and offered maximum readability. I have worked far more hours than most other devs are willing to on this theme, and when you get use to using it you will find that it has become such an asset you will not be able to get rid of it.

A good case could be made that the most important tool/extension that a developer will need when using V.S.-Code is the THEME that the equip to it. VSC allows deep customization of themes

V.S. Code Theme: 'Awakening'

> ### Notes on what to include in the README.md Document
>
> 1. VSCode extensions and widgets often use the OverviewRuler (the Scrollbar-Track) to communicate with the developer by highlighting lines. To highlight a line it sets a small colored square on the line that prompted the highlight. The meaning of the message is contengant on the color of the highlight. The scrollBar in the JS_Dojo theme has been made opaque to maintain overviewRuler highlighting readability. The highlight colors, and the scrollbars color have been selected in such a way as to offer maximum readability when the scrollbar overlays a highlighted area within the overview ruler.
