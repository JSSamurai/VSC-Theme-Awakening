# VSC-Theme-Awakening

V.S. Code Theme: 'Awakening'

> ### Notes on what to include in the README.md Document
>
> 1. VSCode extensions and widgets often use the OverviewRuler (the Scrollbar-Track) to communicate with the developer by highlighting lines. To highlight a line it sets a small colored square on the line that prompted the highlight. The meaning of the message is contengant on the color of the highlight. The scrollBar in the JS_Dojo theme has been made opaque to maintain overviewRuler highlighting readability. The highlight colors, and the scrollbars color have been selected in such a way as to offer maximum readability when the scrollbar overlays a highlighted area within the overview ruler.
